                    I am currently getting my degree from the University of Florida in Computer Science with a minor in the Innovation-Artificial Intelligence Track.
                    With graduation coming up soon in December of 2023, I currently looking for a position at a company I can call home after I graduate!

                <p className="pb-5">
                    Despite my confidence being in Back-End development, I have done two internships at OneHope, Inc. as a Software Development Intern in which I was able to work with the Full Tech Stack. 
                    I gained experience with .NET Framework, SQL Management Studio, and Vue.js. Through working on a fully functioning team, I was also able to get experience with 
                    the Scrum and Agile Methodologies.
                </p>
                <p className="pb-5">
                    In addition to experience with Vue.js, I worked with React.js and Tailwind CSS to develop this Portfolio Page.
